## Description

The goal of this project was to clean up the exisiting code so that it follows appropriate semantic HTML. I condensed the CSS code down, getting rid of duplicate codes and eliminated unnecessary classes in the HTML. I also added alt attributes to images as well as fixed a broken link. A more simplified code is easier to read and make future changes to so this will help a lot in the long run.
